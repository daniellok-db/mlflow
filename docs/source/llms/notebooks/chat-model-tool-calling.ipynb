    "Welcome to the notebook tutorial on building a simple tool calling model using the [`mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel`](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.ChatModel) wrapper. ChatModel is a subclass of MLflow's highly customizable [PythonModel](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel), which was specifically designed to make GenAI workflows easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, here are some of the benefits of using ChatModel:\n",
    "1. No need to define a complex signature! Chat models often accept complex inputs with many levels of nesting, and this can be cumbersome to define yourself.\n",
    "2. Support for JSON / dict inputs (no need to wrap inputs or convert to Pandas DataFrame)\n",
    "2. Dataclasses for expected inputs / outputs for a better development experience\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in-depth exploration of ChatModel, please check out the [detailed guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/chat-model-guide/index.html).\n",
